# LYRIKA_BELIKA

LYRIKA_BELIKA is a project aimed at generating genre-specific song lyrics using a dual-input LSTM model, focusing on the genres of corridos, regional mexicano, and norte√±o. 
The project leverages data from approximately 10,000 song lyrics, with the integration of Spotify and Genius APIs for metadata and lyrical content. 
The end goal is to produce authentic, stylistically accurate lyrics that reflect the unique characteristics of these traditional Mexican music genres.
